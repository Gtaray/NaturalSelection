# Natural Selection

## Selecting

This extension for Fantasy Grounds adds an intuitive way to deal with multiple tokens stacked together on the same grid space. When you select a token that shares its space with another token, a small pop up window will appear displaying the stacked tokens. You can then select which of the stacked tokens you want to interact with in the pop up menu. Doing so will bring the selected token to the top of the stack and select it for you.

## Targeting

You can also target tokens within a stack either by holding Control when you select the token stack, or by holding Control when you select the token from the popup window

## Drag/Drop

Lastly, after you open the token selector window, you can drop rolls (and any other drag/drop action) directly onto tokens within that window.

## Game Options

There is a single game option to control where, relative to the token being selected, the token selector window pops up.
